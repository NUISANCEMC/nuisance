This folder contains the data release for the transverse kinematic imbalance (TKI) paper {}.

The files, xsec_{dpTT/pN/daT}.root, contain the best-fit cross section and associated covariance matrices for the measured double-transverse momentum imbalance dpTT, initial nucleon momentum pN and transverse boosting angle daT respectively.

In each file, there are following histograms:
-- TH1D xsec_best_fit:  best-fit TKI cross section
-- TH2D xsec_cov:       cross section covariance matrix
-- TH2D xsec_shape_cov: cross section shape covariance matrix
-- TH1D flux_best_fit:  best-fit numu flux spectrum
-- TH2D flux_cov:       flux covariance matrix

The text files, xsec_{dpTT/pN/daT}.txt, show the corresponding histograms in plain text format.
