This set of quick and dirty scripts run rolling validations of a given nuisance branch if run-nightly-test is setup
to run at midnight with a cronjob

To setup, the xml files in base-comparisons-1 need to be edited to point to the correct input files, and the generator
setup script needs to be pointed to all external libraries.

run-nightly-test will checkout the branch, build it, run any comparisons, then clean and tar up the used branch code.

When first setting up, a stable bench mark should be created by running create-benchmark.sh
